## **Key Features**

1. **Google Authentication**  
   - Easy social login using **Auth0** and Google accounts.  
   - New users are automatically onboarded.

2. **Dynamic Problem Listings**  
   - Problems are fetched dynamically from the backend.  
   - A green tick âœ… indicates solved problems.

3. **Real-Time Code Execution**  
   - Integrated **Monaco Editor** for a rich coding experience.  
   - **Run** operation validates code against visible test cases.  
   - **Submit** executes code against hidden and visible test cases.

4. **AI-Powered Code Analysis**  
   - After successful submission, the platform provides:  
     - **Time Complexity** and **Space Complexity** reports.  

5. **User Activity History**  
   - Displays the last **15 submissions** with detailed results.

6. **Battle Room** (Competitive Coding)  
   - Real-time coding battles between friends using **WebSockets**.  
   - Random questions are assigned; the player solving the most questions wins.

7. **Pro Mode Features**  
   - AI-driven suggestions for improving code efficiency.  
   - AI-based test case generation for custom inputs.
